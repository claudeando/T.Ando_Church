# T.Ando_Church

This is a three.js project to recreate a Tadao Ando's famous church.
It was bundled in Vite and the tech-stacks required were JavaScript, ThreeJS, HTML, and CSS.

To challenge myself, no 3D modelling softwares were involved. 

Once I have more time, this church will be more polished to a version where users can explore the whole scene.
